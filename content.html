            A DISCOURSE ON THE DEPICTION OF HISTORY within the realm
            of media
          </h1>
          <p>
            The race issue surrounding Queen Charlotte in "The Bridgerton"
            series revolves around the show's decision to portray her as a Black
            queen. In real history, Queen Charlotte, who was married to King
            George III of England, was of mixed heritage, with a possible
            African ancestry through her Portuguese and German lineage. However,
            her exact racial background has been a subject of debate among
            historians.

              >A combination of a historical truth â€“ which is to say that the
              past is more diverse than we tend to not only see on screen, but also accept in our popular imagination. But it should also be allowed to fictionalise,
              thereby asking what history might look like under certain different
              circumstances. Circumstances that elevate people of color beyond typecast roles that only serve to cause harm to an already divisive society. -
