            THE DISCOURSE OF CONCERNING THE DEPICTION OF HISTORY within the ream
            of media
          </h1>
          <p>
            The race issue surrounding Queen Charlotte in "The Bridgerton"
            series revolves around the show's decision to portray her as a Black
            queen. In real history, Queen Charlotte, who was married to King
            George III of England, was of mixed heritage, with a possible
            African ancestry through her Portuguese and German lineage. However,
            her exact racial background has been a subject of debate among
            historians.

              past is more diverse than we tend to see on screen, and we tend to
              accept in our popular imagination. But it’s also a fictionalising,
              asking what history might look like under certain different
              circumstances.-
